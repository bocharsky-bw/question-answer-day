Ask Questions!
==============

Hi guys! It's time for KnpU Question and Answer day: your chance to submit
your burning programming questions and our chance to listen for a change! Here's how
it works:

1) **Ask your questions** about PHP, Symfony, Behat, dinosaurs, or anything else as
as a *comment* on this page before the closing time and we'll pretend to know the answers.

.. note::

    You have until the end of Tuesday, March 26th, 2013 to post questions!

    **(Psssst - the comments are over on the right side ===================>)**

2) The next day, we'll open this page up and start answering them! 
   Follow us on Twitter and if you include your Twitter 
   handle with your question, we'll give you a shout-out.

.. note::

    Answer day is Wednesday, March 27th, 2013. Follow us on twitter `@KnpUniversity`_

That's it! We really want to hear what questions you're having in your real projects. We can't
guarantee we'll be able to answer every question, but we'll give it the old college try ;).

And remember any question or code gists you post are public.
So, it may be a good idea to not tell the world what your database password is :)

See ya then!
